\item{period_2}{(optional) First seasonal frequency. Uses "auto" by default. A character phrase
of "auto" or time-based phrase of "2 weeks" can be used if a date or date-time variable is provided.}

\item{period_3}{(optional) First seasonal frequency. Uses "auto" by default. A character phrase
of "auto" or time-based phrase of "2 weeks" can be used if a date or date-time variable is provided.}

\item{use.parallel}{\code{TRUE/FALSE} indicates whether or not to use parallel processing.}
